# CudaUniqueSearch
UniqueSearchOnGPU

This project generates a large number of random numbers, some of which are non-repeating. 
Subsequently, using the capabilities of the graphics card, the generated sequence is sorted, and then, 
within the sorted array, the graphics card is also used to search for unique values.
